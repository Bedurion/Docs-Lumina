      label: 'Documentation overview',
      title: 'Understand the system before configuring it.',
      introduction: 'Luminox is a collection of connected Discord workflows rather than a list of isolated commands. Identity, guild membership, panels, permissions, activity and permanent Discord records work together, so the documentation begins with the purpose of each system before showing its controls.',
      solves: 'It gives members, staff and administrators one place to understand what Luminox manages and which guide answers their current question.',
      audience: 'New members, guild leaders evaluating Luminox, moderators learning their tools and administrators configuring a server.',

      title: 'Build the foundation before publishing panels.',
      introduction: 'The first setup establishes which guild, world, Discord roles and staff roles Luminox is allowed to trust. Every public panel depends on that foundation. This guide explains the safe order and separates member actions from administrator configuration.',
      solves: 'It prevents partially configured panels, incorrect role assignments and repeated setup attempts that are harder to diagnose later.',
      audience: 'Administrators installing Luminox and staff members who need to understand the server structure.',

      label: 'Panel directory explained',
      title: 'Know what every panel is for before publishing it.',
      introduction: 'Panels are the normal member interface for Luminox. They replace memorized slash commands with buttons, selectors and guided forms while keeping live controls at the bottom and permanent history above. This directory explains the purpose, audience and prerequisite of every panel.',
      solves: 'It helps administrators choose the correct channel and prevents members from seeing duplicated commands and controls for the same workflow.',
      audience: 'Administrators planning the server layout and staff deciding which systems their guild actually needs.',

      label: 'Registration explained',
      title: 'Connect one Discord account to verified game identities.',
